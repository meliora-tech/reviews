# About the project

In this project I scraped reviews from [Hello Peter]() for several event ticketing companies in South Africa. I then applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques on
the reviews and produced three blog posts for [Vibin](), an event ticketing platform in South Africa. Here are the links to the articles:
